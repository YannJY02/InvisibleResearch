## Objective
Add a new variable first_author_experience to capture the difference between a paper's publication year and the first authorâ€™s earliest publication year within the dataset.

## Details
- Scope: notebooks/04_processing/dimension_create_variables.ipynb
- Source data: data/processed/dimension_merged.parquet
- Definition: first_author_experience = paper_year - first_author_first_year (>= 0)
- First author key priority: researchers[0].id -> authors[0].id. Name-based matching is disabled by default to reduce collisions.
- Year source: prefer `year`; fallback to extracting year from `date`.
- Missing data: if first-author key or years are not parseable, set NA.
- Debug-only fields (not in final output): first_author_key, first_author_first_year.
- Column placement: directly after invisibility/time block as discussed.
- Known limitation: earliest year is within this dataset only.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New module added after Open Access status section with rationale and reproducible code cell
- [ ] Variable computed and merged into final DataFrame
- [ ] Column ordering updated to include first_author_experience in the agreed position
- [ ] QA checks extended: missingness, distribution, non-negativity assertion
- [ ] Docs updated to reflect the new variable definition and lineage
