# Tips for Effective Agent Interaction

## 1. Be Specific About Scope
❌ Vague: "Analyze some data"
✅ Clear: "Perform network analysis on the author collaboration data in creator_sample_clean.parquet"

## 2. Specify Output Requirements
❌ Generic: "Write something about this"
✅ Detailed: "Create a 2,000-word literature review in APA format with at least 30 recent references"
